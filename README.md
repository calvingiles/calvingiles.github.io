## Left

This blog is based on [Left](https://github.com/holman/left). Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

If you like it, either clone the original from [holman](https://github.com/holman/left), or feel free to grab a copy of mine. I work out of the master branch as this is a User page on gh-pages. Just branch it to gh-pages to make a project site.

## Licensing

The left theme is [MIT](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats.

The rest of the site is is under a separate MIT license.
