It seems compulsary to start with this. I chose to write this blog just for me. It is a place to record things worth remembering, but with a little more care than Yet Another List App. I hope to make every post interesting, but I will let any random passers by decide that...

As you are still reading this, here is a little about me:

## Where I come from

I studied Physics at the University of Southampton. I spent three years cutting my teeth in the real world making [Neutron Detectors](http://www.symetrica.com/news/2011/2011_10_11_1.php) for homeland security and getting stuck into the  statistics of measuring [radioactive decay rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay#Mathematics_of_radioactive_decay), one of the purest examples of independent random events around. I then spent two years in a Physics Consultancy in Cambridge, UK learning how to solve problems and messing around with hardware and dirty signals.

## What I am up to now (August 2014)

I currently work as a Data Scientist for Adthena. I am also occasionally a Consultant for [ModelInsight](http://modelinsight.io/). I attend a few of the London [meet-ups](http://www.meetup.com/members/88252352/) and am getting increasingly involved in [PyData London](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/). I just founded [Untangle](http://untangleconsulting.io) so that I can take the interesting conversations I keep getting into about Data Science a little further.

## Where my focus is for the future

I am interested in statistics, machine learning, text processing, good software design, creative problem solving and data science work-flow. I learn from blogs, MOOCs, colleagues, friends and google. I am enjoying working for a product company for the focus it provides and I like the variety consulting offers --- like my knowledge, I wish my experience to be [T-shaped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).
