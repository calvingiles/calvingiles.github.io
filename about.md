# {{ site.name }}

I am the Data Scientist at [Adthena](http://www.adthena.com/) --- a physicist in a room of excellent software engineers. I am also occasionally a Consultant for [ModelInsight](http://modelinsight.io/).

I attend a few of the London [meet-ups](http://www.meetup.com/members/88252352/) and am getting increasingly involved in [PyData London](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/). If you see me in person, why not break the London tradition and say hi? I occassionally (re-)[tweet](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) and share the odd [gist]({{ site.github.owner_url }}) or two.
